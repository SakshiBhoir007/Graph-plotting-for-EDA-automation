# Graph-plotting-for-EDA-automation
I have created a function called "graphs". This function will find out the datatype of each column (which are passed by users or default: all) will categorize them on the based of numerical or categorical column and will return the graph according to the their datatypes. Histogram and boxplot for numerical datatype column and Bar plot for categorical columns. The output image will be saved in specified directory if mentioned by user or by default it will save in Current Working Directory. Using this function we can achieve optimization and its time saving.
